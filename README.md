# DataScience_Nanodegree_p3-Recommendation

## Intro
This repository refers to the third project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree in which we develop a recommendation engine for articles on the IBM Watson platform.

The goal is to recommend interesting articles on the IBM Watson Platform to the user based on his/her preferences and interests. 

## What's in here?
The main content in this repo is the jupyter notebook in which you find all about this recommendation engine as well as some insight to the data

This includes:
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Rank Based Recommendations
 - User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
 - Matrix Factorization
 - Extras & Concluding

## Install
To run the notebook you pretty much just need a standard Anaconda-installment. The data is also included in this repo, so you should be good to go after cloning the repo.
